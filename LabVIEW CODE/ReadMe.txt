All the software and codes are running under the Windows 10 system (64 bit) on a normal desktop. No non-standard hardware is required.
This work is conducted by using the following software and codes:

Nanonis SPM Control Software (Version V5), provided by SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH. It is the controlling system software of the scanning probe microscope in this work.

LabVIEW 2020 (subscribed version), provided by National Instruments Corp. It is the operational platform.

LabVIEW Programming Interface is used in this work, provided by SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH. The interface software is used to connect LabVIEW 2020 and Nanonis SPM Control Software V5.

The deep neural network models are attached, which use Python (Version 3.6). The method of connecting between Python codes and LabVIEW 2020 is included.

The Nanonis SPM Control Software, LabVIEW Programming Interface, and the LabVIEW 2020 commercially available thus not available in our repo, one shall contact the corresponding companies (SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH, National Instruments Corp.) to the permission to use.
